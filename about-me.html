        Hi. I'm me, and that's what you are reading about. I mean that's why you clicked on 'About Me', right? Why else would you do that? You are definitely not the type to click there by accident.

        Well, since I have your attention, I am the person who likes hiking in the Appalachain Mountains, especially in NC. And I like fresh vegetables, which is why I grow them. So, if you like either of those, you will like the few images I have gathered until this point.
